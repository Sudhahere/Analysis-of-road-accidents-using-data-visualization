Roadway traffic safety is a major concern for transportation governing agencies as well as ordinary citizens. In order to give safe driving suggestions, careful analysis of roadway traffic data is critical to find out variables that are closely related to fatal accidents. The relationship between fatal rate and other attributes including collision manner, weather, surface condition, causality severity, and driver age were investigated. Association rules were discovered by Apriori algorithm, classification model was built by Naive Bayes classifier, and clusters were formed by a simple K-means clustering algorithm. Certain safety driving suggestions were made based on statistics, association rules, classification model, and clusters obtained.
